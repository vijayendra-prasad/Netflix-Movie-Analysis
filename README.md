# Netflix-Movie-Analysis
This project is a comprehensive analysis of movies available on Netflix. The data used in this project is downloaded from an unofficial Netflix database available on Kaggle, which includes a vast variety of features such as Movie/TV Show identification, director, cast, country of origin, date added on platform, release year, rating, duration and listed in categories.


**Key Insights**
Through this analysis, I explored various aspects of the Netflix movie catalogue. Here are some key insights:
Content Type: The distribution of content types showed that Netflix has a larger number of movies compared to TV shows.

**Growth Over Time**: The number of movies and TV shows on Netflix has increased over the years, indicating that Netflix is continually expanding its library.
Content Production by Country: A significant proportion of content available on Netflix is produced in the United States. Other countries that contribute greatly include India, United Kingdom and Canada.

**Most Popular Genres**: The most common genres of content available on Netflix include "International Movies", "Dramas", and "Comedies".
Content Rating: Majority of the content available on Netflix is rated as 'TV-MA' (Mature Audience) or 'TV-14' (Parents strongly urged to give "special guidance" for children under 14).

**Average Duration:** The duration data provides insights into the average movie length in the Netflix catalogue.
These insights were drawn based on the analyses conducted up until the point of my latest commit. Note that the dataset will continue to become outdated as Netflix expands its library.
 
Sure, here are some step-by-step instructions for this Netflix Data Analysis project:

## 1. Setup Environment
Before you start, you need to set up your Python environment. Make sure you have Python installed, and you're able to install packages using pip. Create a virtual environment if necessary.

## 2. Install Necessary Libraries
Use pip to install the libraries necessary for this project. The main libraries we'll be using are pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. You can install these by using the following command:
```sh
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
```

## 3. Get the Data
Download the Netflix dataset from Kaggle or any other public platform. Save the downloaded CSV file in your project directory.

## 4. Load and Explore the Data
Use pandas to load the CSV file into a DataFrame. Use functions like `df.head()`, `df.info()`, and `df.describe()` to explore the data.

## 5. Clean the Data
Remove duplicates, handle missing values, and perform any other necessary data cleaning steps. 

## 6. Perform Data Analysis
Now you can perform different analyses on your data. You might want to check which director has the most movies, which year had the most movie releases, what's the average movie duration, and so on.

## 7. Visualize the Results
Use matplotlib or any other visualization library to visualize your results. This might include bar graphs of movie counts, histograms of durations, etc.

## 8. Document Your Findings
Write a report of your findings. This might be in the form of a Jupyter notebook with cells of markdown text interspersed with code.

## 9. Upload on GitHub
Initiate a git repository in your project directory, commit your work, and push your commit to GitHub. Make sure your repository also includes a descriptive README, which contains project information, usage instructions, and findings.

Here's how you set up a git repository:
```sh
# Navigate to your project folder
cd <project_folder_path>

# Initialize a git repository
$ git init

# add files to Staging area
$ git add .

# Commit your files
$ git commit -m 'Initial commit'

# Go to your GitHub account and create a new repository, then connect your local repository to the GitHub
$ git remote add origin <url_of_your_github_repo>

# Push your local commits to the GitHub repository
$ git push -u origin master
```

## 10. Share Your Work
Now that you've pushed your work to GitHub, you can share it with others. You might also want to consider showcasing this project in your portfolio if you're job hunting.

This project is a beginner-friendly task that will help you grasp the practical implementation of data analysis concepts. You're doing a great job! Happy learning!
