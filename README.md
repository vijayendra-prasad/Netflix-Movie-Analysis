# Netflix-Movie-Analysis
This project is a comprehensive analysis of movies available on Netflix. The data used in this project is downloaded from an unofficial Netflix database available on Kaggle, which includes a vast variety of features such as Movie/TV Show identification, director, cast, country of origin, date added on platform, release year, rating, duration and listed in categories.


**Key Insights**
Through this analysis, I explored various aspects of the Netflix movie catalogue. Here are some key insights:
Content Type: The distribution of content types showed that Netflix has a larger number of movies compared to TV shows.

**Growth Over Time**: The number of movies and TV shows on Netflix has increased over the years, indicating that Netflix is continually expanding its library.
Content Production by Country: A significant proportion of content available on Netflix is produced in the United States. Other countries that contribute greatly include India, United Kingdom and Canada.

**Most Popular Genres**: The most common genres of content available on Netflix include "International Movies", "Dramas", and "Comedies".
Content Rating: Majority of the content available on Netflix is rated as 'TV-MA' (Mature Audience) or 'TV-14' (Parents strongly urged to give "special guidance" for children under 14).

**Average Duration:** The duration data provides insights into the average movie length in the Netflix catalogue.
These insights were drawn based on the analyses conducted up until the point of my latest commit. Note that the dataset will continue to become outdated as Netflix expands its library.
